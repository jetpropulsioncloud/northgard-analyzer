## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **The Longhouse**, please help us by reporting it **privately**.

### Please do not:
- Post it publicly in GitHub issues or discussions
- Exploit it or test it on other users
- Share the vulnerability with others before it's patched

### Instead:
- Email: `jetpropulsioncloud@gmail.com` (or another email if you prefer)
- Or DM me directly on Reddit/Discord if you're part of the community post

We will respond as soon as possible and aim to resolve critical issues quickly.

## 🔐 Additional Notes

This project is currently in **testing and hobby phase**. While security is important to us, it is not production-grade. Please use the app with that in mind.

Thank you for helping keep the project safe!
